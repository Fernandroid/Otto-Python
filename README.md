# Otto-Python
Otto Kaggle challenge. 
The objective is to build a predictive model which is able to distinguish between  nine main product categories. The dataset provided has 93 features for more than 200,000 products. These programs (see Otto and Otto2 build the following models:

 Support Vector Machine
 
 Boosting model: AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting
 
 Neuronal networks: NN with 2 hidden layers and for multliple labels clsssification (DropoutNN2hl function)
 and NN dropout NN with 2 hidden layers (NNSoftMax function)
 
 Ensemble model in BlendingModel and BaggingKnn.
